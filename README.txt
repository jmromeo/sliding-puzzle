The Sliding Puzzle project is a project meant to grasp the basics of
game development, graphics, and artificial intelligence.  We will first
implement a simple version of the Sliding Puzzle game not using any type
of model.  We will then attempt to create the game using an MVC pattern.
After that, we will attempt to create the game with the Game Model.


NOTE: pygame.init must be called before SlidingPuzzle libraries can be
      used!
